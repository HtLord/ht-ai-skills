# SOLID Principles

The SOLID principles are a set of design principles that help software developers create more understandable, flexible, and maintainable programs. These principles are particularly important in object-oriented programming. The acronym SOLID stands for:  

1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**  
   A class should have one, and only one, reason to change, meaning that a class should only have one job or responsibility.  

2. **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**  
   Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification. This means you should be able to add new functionality to a class without changing its existing code.  

3. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**  
   Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correct behavior of the program. This principle ensures that a derived class can stand in for its base class.  

4. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**  
   No client should be forced to depend on methods it does not use. Instead of a large, general-purpose interface, many small, client-specific interfaces are preferred.  

5. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**  
   High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions (e.g., interfaces). This reduces the coupling between different parts of a program.  

Understanding and applying the SOLID principles allows developers to create systems that are easier to manage, understand, and scale. These principles serve as a guideline for writing clean code and improving development processes.  

By following SOLID principles as a Claude skill, developers can enhance their coding practices and create software that is not only functional but also sustainable for future growth.
